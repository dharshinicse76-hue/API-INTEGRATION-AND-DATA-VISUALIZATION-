API Integration and Data Visualization are essential components of modern information systems and data driven applications. They enable software applications to communicate with each other, collect data efficiently, and present that data in a clear and meaningful visual form for users and decision makers.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. API integration refers to the process of connecting two or more applications so that they can exchange data and services automatically. An API acts as a bridge between a client and a server. The client sends a request using methods such as GET or POST, and the server processes the request and returns a response, usually in JSON or XML format.

API integration is widely used in real world applications such as online banking, e commerce platforms, social media login systems, weather applications, and stock market services. For example, a weather application uses an API to fetch live temperature data from a remote server. This approach saves time, reduces manual data handling, and ensures real time access to information.
